# Connect HT-M01 to a LoRa Server
[简体中文](https://heltec-automation.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/gateway/ht-m01/connect_to_server.html)
## Summary

This article aims to describe how to connect [HT-M01 Gateway](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m01) to a LoRa server, such as [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/), which facilitates secondary development and rapid deployment of LoRa devices.ff

Before all operation, make sure the HT-M01 is runing well with a Raspberry Pi (Linux) or Windows computer. If not, please refer to this [HT-M01 Quick Start](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gateway/ht-m01/quick_start.html) document.

&nbsp;

## Connect to TTN/TTS

### Register a LoRa gateway in TTN

Select a cluster in the [TTN console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/) page to start adding devices and gateways. Or start adding devices and gateways in [TTS console](https://lora.heltec.org/console).

Create a new gateway.

Fill in the HT-M01 information as shown below and complete the addition.

![](img/connect_to_server/10.png)

- **Gateway EUI** -- The unique ID of HT-M01S gateway, view from the display screen of the HT-M01S or view through the serial port (the gateway ID will be printed through the serial port when the HT-M01S starts).
- **Gateway ID** -- Generated by default.
- **Gateway name** -- Filled in by the user, can be filled in arbitrarily.
- **Frequency Plan** -- Matches the LoRa band configuration in HT-M01S.

### Configure the Gateway

In the HT-M01 gateway, need to configure the gateway ID, server address and port.

Check the server address in the gateway details.

#### HT-M01 in Linux (Raspberry Pi)

Fix parameters in `global_conf.json`:

```shell
  nano /home/pi/lora/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/global_conf.json
```

 Configure gateway ID, server address, port. At the end of the `global_conf.json`, make these changes:


  ```json
  “gateway_ID”: “XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX”, /*Your gateway ID, 16 characters*/
  “server_address”: “router.cn.thethings.network”, /*The router addresses need matach your region*/
  “serv_port_up”: 1700,
  “serv_port_down”: 1700,
  ```

`ctrl + O` to save and `ctrl + X` to exit, and restart the service in Raspberry Pi:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart lrgateway
```

#### HT-M01 in Windows

Select `Use a cloud network`, and fill in correct `server address`, keep `Port` default 1700.

## Connect to ChirpStack server

[ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/) is the most popular LoRa server open source project, widely used in many fields, and also the best choise for a private LoRa server.

- ChirpStack Installation guide: [https://www.chirpstack.io/overview/](https://www.chirpstack.io/overview/)
- ChirpStack support forum: [https://forum.chirpstack.io/](https://forum.chirpstack.io/)

### ChirpStack Gateway Bridge

**One thing need attention!** the ChirpStack need a special service named `Gateway Bridge`, which converts LoRa® Packet Forwarder protocols into a ChirpStack Network Server common data-format(JSON and Protobuf).

The `Gateway Bridge` service can running on the Raspberry Pi or the ChirpStack server. We recommend install it on the Raspberry Pi.

Install LoRa-gateway-bridge:

```shell
wget https://artifacts.loraserver.io/downloads/lora-gateway-bridge/lora-gateway-bridge_2.5.1_armhf.deb
#Download the LoRa-gateway-bridge package that supports the Raspberry Pi Zero_W version
sudo dpkg -i lora-gateway-bridge_2.5.1_armhf.deb
#Install LoRa-gateway-bridge
sudo systemctl start lora-gateway-bridge
#Start LoRa-gateway-bridge
sudo systemctl enable lora-gateway-bridge
#Set LoRa-gateway-bridge to boot up
```

Install ChirpStack Gateway Bridge can refer to [https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/install/debian](https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/install/debian)

Starting the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge:

```shell
sudo systemctl start chirpstack-gateway-bridge
```

### Register LoRa Gateway in ChirpStack

Fill in the HT-M01 information as shown below and complete the addition.

- **Gateway ID** -- The unique ID of HT-M01 gateway。

### Configure the Gateway

In the HT-M01 gateway, need to configure the gateway ID, server address and port.

#### HT-M01 in Linux (Raspberry Pi)

Fix parameters in `global_conf.json`:

```shell
  nano /home/pi/lora/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/global_conf.json
```

 Configure gateway ID, server address, port. At the end of the `global_conf.json`, make these changes:


  ```json
  “gateway_ID”: “XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX”, /*Your gateway ID, 16 characters*/
  “server_address”: “router.eu.thethings.network”, /*The router addresses need matach your region*/
  “serv_port_up”: 1700,
  “serv_port_down”: 1700,
  ```

`ctrl + O` to save and `ctrl + X` to exit, and restart the service in Raspberry Pi:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart lrgateway
```

#### HT-M01 in Windows

Fill in the correct `ID`, `server address`, keep `Port` default 1700.
